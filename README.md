## Installation

- First we'll clone this repository to our local machine, if you don't have the git CLI just download the repository.
- Once we have the cloned repository we'll install the required node modules.
- Wait for a while, after all the required modules are installed, we'll edit the JSON inside `/src/builder.js` to our liking.
- Now once we're done, we'll build for production and have our files in the `/dist` directory.
